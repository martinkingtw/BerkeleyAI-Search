# Project 2 Multi-Agent Search

Website: http://ai.berkeley.edu/multiagent.html

The project is my personal implementation of agents with different evaluation functions, including Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning.

If you like to see the implementation, then autograder.py provides an easy way to see the stats of each implementation.  

```
py autograder.py
```

Alternatively, if you would like to play pacman, then run  

```
py pacman.py
py pacman.py --help
```

## Implementations
