# Project 2 Multi-Agent Search

Website: http://ai.berkeley.edu/multiagent.html

The project is my personal implementation of agents with different evaluation functions, including Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning.

If you would like to have a quick overview of the implementation, then autograder.py provides an easy way to see the stats of each implementation.  

```
py autograder.py
```

If you would like to have a graphic representation of the implementation, then you can run the following command for each individual question.

```
# Example: Q1
py autograder.py -q q1
```

Alternatively, if you would like to play pacman, then run  

```
py pacman.py
py pacman.py --help
```

## Implementations

Q1: State-Action pair evaluation functions

Q2: Minimax

Q3: Alpha-Beta Pruning
