# Project 3 Reinforcement Learning

Website: http://ai.berkeley.edu/reinforcement.html

The project is my personal implementation of value iteration and Q-learning in different scenarios.

If you like to see the implementation, then autograder.py provides an easy way to see the stats of each implementation.  

```
py autograder.py
```

Alternatively, if you would like to play GridWorld game, then run  

```
py gridworld.py
py gridworld.py --help
```

## Implementations
