# Project 4 Inference

Website: http://ai.berkeley.edu/tracking.html

The project is my personal implementation of both exact and approximate inference using Bayes' Nets.

If you like to see the implementation, then autograder.py provides an easy way to see the stats of each implementation.  

```
py autograder.py
```

Alternatively, if you would like to play the ghost buster game, then run  

```
py busters.py
py busters.py --help
```
