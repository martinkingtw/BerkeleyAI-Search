# Project 4 Inference

Website: http://ai.berkeley.edu/tracking.html

The project is my personal implementation of both exact and approximate inference using Bayes' Nets.

If you would like to have a quick overview of the implementation, then autograder.py provides an easy way to see the stats of each implementation.  

```
py autograder.py
```

If you would like to have a graphic representation of the implementation, then you can run the following command for each individual question.

```
# Example: Q2
py autograder.py -q q2
```

Alternatively, if you would like to play the ghost buster game, then run  

```
py busters.py
py busters.py --help
```
