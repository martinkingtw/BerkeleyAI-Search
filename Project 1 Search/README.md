# Project 1 Search

Website: http://ai.berkeley.edu/search.html

The project is my personal implementation of different search methods, including A* search and designing efficient heuristics.  

If you like to see the implementation, then autograder.py provides an easy way to see the stats of each implementation.  

```
py autograder.py
```

Alternatively, if you would like to play pacman, then run  

```
py pacman.py
py pacman.py --help
```

## Implementations  

Q1: Depth First Search, DFS  

Q2: Breadth First Search, BFS  

Q3: Uniform Cost Search, UCS  

Q4: A* search  

Q5: Design abstract state representation  

Q6: Design heuristics  

Q7: Another abstract state representation and heuristics  

Q8: Suboptimal Search
